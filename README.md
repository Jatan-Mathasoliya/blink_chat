⚠️ Project Update

This project was a solo learning journey to build a real-time chat app (BlinkChat) using the MERN stack. I implemented and deployed the core one-to-one chat functionality successfully.

However, as I progressed further — especially with features like group chat and public channels — I faced increasingly complex bugs and architectural challenges. Since much of the code was based on tutorials, it became difficult to extend and debug beyond what was shown.

Due to these challenges and limited support resources, I’ve decided to pause further development for now. The project remains a valuable milestone in my learning journey, especially in understanding real-world debugging, asynchronous programming, and the limits of copy-paste development.

✅ One-to-one chat still works — feel free to try it out!
